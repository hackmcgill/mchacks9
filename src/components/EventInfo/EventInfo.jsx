            This year, McHacks is going global! For 36 hours, the best and brightest students from around the
            world will connect remotely and build their dreams.
          </p>
          <p>
            Near Montr√©al? We'll be choosing a select cohort of people to attend the event in-person and join us on McGill campus
            for 36 hours of hacking, food, and fun.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whichever way you choose to attend, you'll get the full McHacks experience of innovation, networking, &amp; workshops.
