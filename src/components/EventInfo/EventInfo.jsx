                        This year, McHacks is going global! For 36 hours, the best and brightest students from around the
                        world will connect remotely and build their dreams.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Near Montr√©al? We'll be choosing a select cohort of people to attend the event in-person and join us on McGill campus
                        for 36 hours of hacking, food, and fun.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Whichever way you choose to attend, you'll get the full McHacks experience of innovation, networking, &amp; workshops.
